[**Lacey Wade**](https://www.laceywade.com/) is a lecturer currently teaching courses in both sociolinguistics and general linguistics. Her research is focused on understanding how sociolinguistic knowledge is mentally represented and utilized in speech perception and production.

[**Andrea Beltrama**](https://andreabeltrama.com) is a lecturer and postdoc. He is interested in understanding of how interlocutors signal and interpret meanings across different dimensions, focusing on two main themes: the formal and socio-cognitive processes whereby humans compute the message conveyed by linguistic utterances; and how these processes inform the activities that humans engage in when communicating â€” e.g., exchanging information; projecting/perceiving social identity; and expressing agreement or disagreement. To this end, he adopts a cross-disciplinary perspective, combining theories and methods from semantics/pragmatics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, and focusing on different phenomena such as (im)precision; gradability; subjective and emotive language; and human-AI interaction.

[**Cesko Voeten**](https://www.fryske-akademy.nl/en/about-us/employees/0/news/detail/cvoeten/) is a postdoc in linguistics working with Meredith Tamminga and Joshua Plotkin (Biology & Mathematics). His research is concerned with the relationship between synchronic variation and diachronic change in vowel systems, and with statistical methods that enable this relationship to be quantified. In his current project, he uses a statistical model from biological evolution to investigate the population-level processes underlying vowel changes in Philadelphia.

[**Yiran Chen**](https://sites.google.com/sas.upenn.edu/yiranchen/home) is a 5th year Ph.D. student in Linguistics (advisor: Katie Schuler). She is interested in language acquisition as well as the language-cognition interface. More specifically, she is interested in questions like how acquisition of sociolinguistic variation informs cognitive and social development as well as how language interacts with non-linguistic representation of events. Outside of research, Yiran enjoys making music and food.

[**Aini Li**](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~liaini) is a 4th year Ph.D. student in Linguistics (advisor: Meredith Tamminga). Her research interests are at the interface of sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. In particular, she is using experimental methods to probe the influence of grammatical, social and cognitive factors on the perception and production of variation.

Broadly speaking, she is interested in speech production in World Englishes. Lately, she has been working on systematic biases in English-ASR systems modulated by speakers' language backgrounds. She has also been working on how sociolinguistic factors condition pitch use in speech production in conversational data.
