I"<p>Welcome to the website for the Language Variation and Cognition Lab! We are located in the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. The lab is directed by <a href="http://meredithtamminga.com/">Meredith Tamminga</a>. We work closely with <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/">David Embick</a> and <a href="http://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/">his lab</a>.</p>

<p>We are affiliated with <a href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/">MindCORE</a>, Pennâ€™s hub for the integrative study of the mind, as well as several of its supported research groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/">Integrated Language Sciences and Technology Initiative</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/">Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/">Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Our research is situated at the intersection of sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Lab members work on a broad range of  topics that are tied together by our shared aims of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modeling the mental representation and processing of inter- and intra-speaker linguistic variability</li>
  <li>Using psycholinguistic evidence as a window on the relationship between social and grammatical influences on variable behavior</li>
  <li>Integrating experimental and naturalistic linguistic data across diverse populations</li>
  <li>Relating individual and group-level linguistic behavior and phenomena, especially with respect to language change</li>
  <li>Developing quantitative approaches to the microtemporal dynamics of language variation in perception and production</li>
</ul>

<p>For selected papers and presentations, see the <a href="https://tammingalab.github.io/research/">Research</a> page.</p>

<p>Inquiries from both prospective undergraduate RAs and prospective Ph.D. students should be directed to Meredith Tamminga.</p>
