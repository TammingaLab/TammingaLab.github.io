### About our research

***

Our research group shares the following general goals: 

- To model the mental representation of variability in language
- To integrate experimental and naturalistic data across diverse populations
- To relate individual and group-level linguistic behavior
- To develop quantitative approaches to the temporal dynamics of language variation

<!--
Current projects in the lab are investigating:

- The cognitive and personality traits of the leaders of language change
- Subjective reactions to stable versus changing variables
- The effect of talker specificity on repetition priming
- Top-down and bottom-up approaches to the quantitative modeling of style
- The effect of individual differences in working memory on morphological priming
- Syntactic priming of intermediate levels of structure in alternations
- Morphological priming with inflectional suffixes
- The effect of dialect exposure on lexical decision to words with merger
