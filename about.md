### About our research

***

Our research group shares the following general goals: 

- To model the mental representation of variability in language
- To integrate experimental and naturalistic data across diverse populations
- To relate individual and group-level linguistic behavior
- To develop quantitative approaches to the temporal dynamics of language variation

Some more specific topics that lab members are currently working on include:

- The cognitive and personality traits of the leaders of language change
- Interspeaker covariation between ongoing sound changes
- Individual differences and cross-talker generalization in perceptual learning
- The relationship between perception and production in phonemic split
- Phonetic convergence to socially evaluated dialect features
- The use of semantic priming methods to investigate phonological variation
- Instrumental articulatory measurement of gradience in phonological variation
- The role of top-down speaker gender cues in processing lexical tone
