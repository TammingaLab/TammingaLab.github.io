Welcome to the website for the Language Variation and Cognition Lab! We are located in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). The lab is directed by [Meredith Tamminga](http://meredithtamminga.com/).

Within Linguistics, we work closely with [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/) and [his lab](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/), which investigates lexical and morphological representation and processing.

We are also affiliated with [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/), Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind, as well as with several of its supported research groups: 
* The [Integrated Language Sciences and Technology Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/)
* The [Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/)
* The [Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/)

Our research is situated at the intersection of sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Broadly speaking, our shared research aims are:
* To model the mental representation and processing of inter- and intra-speaker linguistic variability
* To use psycholinguistic evidence as a window on the interplay between social and grammatical influences on variable behavior
* To integrate experimental and naturalistic data across diverse populations
* To relate individual and group-level linguistic behavior and phenomena, especially with respect to language change
* To develop quantitative approaches to the microtemporal dynamics of language variation in perception and production

Inquiries from both prospective undergraduate RAs and prospective Ph.D. students should be directed to Meredith Tamminga.
