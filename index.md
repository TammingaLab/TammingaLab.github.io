Welcome to the website for the Language Variation and Cognition Lab! We are located in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). The lab is directed by [Meredith Tamminga](http://meredithtamminga.com/).

We are affiliated with [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/), Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind, as well as with several of its supported research groups: 
* The [Integrated Language Sciences and Technology Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/)
* The [Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/)
* The [Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/). 

We work closely with [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/) and [his lab](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/), which investigates lexical and morphological representation and processing.
