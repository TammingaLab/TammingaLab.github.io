Welcome to the website for the Language Variation and Cognition Lab!

We are a lab in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). 

We are affiliated with [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/), Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind, as well as with several of its supported research groups: the [Integrated Language Sciences and Technology Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/), the [Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/), and the [Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/). 

We work closely with [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/) and his [research lab](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/), which investigates lexical and morphological representation and processing.
